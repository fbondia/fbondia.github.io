title: About
summary: |
  I have been working with software development and architecture for over 20 years, creating solutions with the main technologies in the market for small, medium, large and sometimes specially complex companies in the most diverse segments.

  My experience with technology is quite varied, and although my focus right now is Java development, I also work with the Microsoft platform (.Net, Sql Server, MVC, etc.) and I've done developments based on AngularJS, React, Python, Php, Flex, Oracle, MySql, among other technologies.

  I believe to be quite courageous, when exploring subjects and technologies that are totally unknown and through persistence and patience (and maybe some intuition), being able to accomplish the work assigned to me in a short time. These challenges move me.

  In recent years I've been working with an international team in Spain on a very technically sophisticated product that has allowed me to improve what I know and learn a lot of things I didn't know.
